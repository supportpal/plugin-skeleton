## Plugin Skeleton 

This repository is a skeleton for building SupportPal plugins.

Please do not directly clone this repository. Several placeholders should be replaced
 before it can be used correctly.
 
### Getting Started

> **_NOTE:_**  Only available on SupportPal v3 and above.

Use the interactive installer to make use of this skeleton, by issuing the below
command in the base directory of your SupportPal installation:
````
php artisan make:plugin
````

Once complete, read through our [Plugin Development Guide](https://docs.supportpal.com/current/Plugin+Development+Getting+Started)
to get started.

### Structure

The skeleton includes the bare minimum for a basic plugin - a controller
with a settings page to configure the plugin.
